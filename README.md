#  Crypto Ranking App

## Instructions for building
- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project root directory
- Open `CoinRanking.xcodeproj` (No third party dependency is used on the app)
- Run the app from xcode


## Assumptions
- There is little need for UIKit if a project supports SwiftUI


## Challenges
- I appreciated working with relatively large numbers like market cap & volume
